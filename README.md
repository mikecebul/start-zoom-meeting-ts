# Start Zoom Meeting

You need a new Auth Code for each token request. Get this by logging in via oauth and grabbing it from the URL since I don't have a running webserver to grab it from right now.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
